# The `Support` Framework

## What is Support?

In general, it is a series of helper structs, classes, functions, etc that I have found to use in projects from time to time. It is a repository of items that I tend to use and wanted them in one place. 

## Can I use them?

Sure.

## Support?

You can create an issue and/or PR if you wish.
